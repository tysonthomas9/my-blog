My experience at a recent Google Design Sprint i was able to attend at Google office in Bangalore. A few startups from a co-working space called Jaaga was selected for a Design Sprint organised by Google Developer Relations Team in Bangalore, our’s was one of them.

So what is Design Sprint?

Design sprint is basically a structured process to build solutions fast keeping the end user in mind. The sprint’s are carried out on a five-day where we try to come up with a prototype very fast and validate it with users. We have seen that as a startup you have very limited resources and short period of time. It is a constant rush to come up with a solution that is useful to your customers and which sustains your venture.

Looking at the agile development methods like Lean Startup where we are pushed to come up with a working prototype iteratively in a very short period of time, while still maintaining the quality of your solutions using process like continuous integration and deployment with automated testing. But this still involves steps where you have build your solution, launch it and then validate with your user. This takes time and effort just to figure out if your solution is what the user wants.

Design sprint process is a hack to this existing development where you come up with a prototype without actually building it.
